# Covid-19-analysis using Tableau

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which started in China but now it has reached almost every country in the world.
So here is the analysis of Covid-19 spread across the world. I have made a tableau dashboard to show the graphical representation of covid spread. This is a interactive dashboard where you can select any country or states to see the total number of confirmed cases, deaths and recovery cases and top 5 states where it has spread most. You can find this project on Tableau Public. https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidAnalysis_16420843222230/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
